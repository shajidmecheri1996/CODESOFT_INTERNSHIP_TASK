# 🚢 Task 1 – Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.  
This is a classic beginner project with a well-known dataset.

The dataset typically contains information about passengers such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket class (Pclass)
- Fare
- Cabin
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Survival status (Target variable: `0 = Not Survived`, `1 = Survived`)

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model building)

---

## 🚀 Approach
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).  
   - Convert categorical features (Sex, Embarked) into numerical.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze survival rates by gender, age group, and passenger class.  
   - Visualize key insights using graphs.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features (e.g., FamilySize, Title from Name).  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Train models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest.  
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

5. **Prediction**  
   - Predict survival on test dataset.

## 📸 Output
Example model accuracy: **~80%** (depends on preprocessing and model choice).

---

## 🏆 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to handle a real-world dataset with missing values, categorical variables, and perform predictive modeling using machine learning.
